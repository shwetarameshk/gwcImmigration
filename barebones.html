      <h4> Mission Statement </h4>
      <p> In 2017 alone, about 226,000 people were removed from the United States
        because of their status in this country. With this website, we can make a 
        difference by bringing awareness to this subject and inform those with 
        minimal resources, also dealing with similar situations. </p>

      <h4> About Us </h4>  
      <p> <strong>Who We Are:</strong> We are a group of five girls who, through 
        Girls Who Code, came together and decided to make this website. We are all
        high school students living in the bay area who feel a strong connection to our past</p>
      <p> <strong>Why We Are Doing This:</strong> Knowing the current political climate 
        surrounding immigration, we wanted to create a reliable resource for immigrants. 
        Each of us are here because someone in our past decided to come to America to create 
        a brand new beginning for themselves and loved ones. This has inspired us to make people feel safe, 
        or at least know a safe place</p>
