        Girls Who Code, came together and decided to make this website.</div>
      <div> We are all high school students living in the bay area who feel a strong connection to our past.</div>
      <div> <strong> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Why We Are Doing This:</strong> Knowing the current political climate
        surrounding immigration, we wanted to create a reliable resource for immigrants.</div>
      <div> Each of us are here because someone in our past decided to come to America to create
        a brand new beginning for themselves and loved ones.</div> <div> This has inspired us to make people feel safe,
    or at least know a safe place.</div> </p>
